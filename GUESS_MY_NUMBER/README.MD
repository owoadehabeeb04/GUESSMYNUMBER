## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is a guess a number game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 40 and the game has a check button which you canuse to check whether you guessed right or guessed a number that is too low or a number that is too high...the game also has an highscore feature, an again button feature which resets the whole game.

## LESSONS LEARNED

I tested my skills on html and css...which i imroved on how to do a 5 column footer layout and improved on my skills on flexbox and media queries.
i faced some challenges while doing this project which are
-Implementing a highscore feature
-An AGAIN BUTTON FEATURE
-A check button feature
so while i was facing this i went ahead to w3schools.
w3schools is a good platform on how to learn different programming languages.
